        Dawning Canvas API


        -  Single File Library  -
        A cross-platform windowing and graphics context API,
        provides the building blocks for creating windows, and setup for the various native graphics APIs.


        -  Window  -
        A window in canvas is just a native window instance, nothing special, use this if you intend to not use
        the graphics API or any other usecases.


        -  Canvas  -
        A canvas is window or view with graphics, and other backend features setup ready to use.
        Using and creating canvases is the intended usecase of this library, it's supposed to get you as fast as possible rendering on screen.
        use the window API if you need a lower level native window cross platform API.
